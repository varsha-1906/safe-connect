## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev    # Development mode
   npm start      # Production mode
   ```

The backend server will start on port 5000 by default.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The frontend development server will start on port 3000 by default.

## Quick Setup Script

You can use the included `setup.sh` script to install dependencies for both frontend and backend at once:

```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Build for Production

### Frontend Build

```
cd frontend
npm run build
```

This will create optimized production build in the `frontend/build` directory.

### Deployment

For deployment, you can serve the backend and frontend separately or configure the backend to serve the frontend build.
